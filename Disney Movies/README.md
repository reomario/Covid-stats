## Disney Movies Data Analysis 
This project seeks to find the relationship between box office gross and MPAA ratings in Disney
movies. The common assumption is that G-rated movies generate the most revenue because
the largest portion of viewers are allowed admittance to these movies, children and adults alike.
Does this assumption hold true?
